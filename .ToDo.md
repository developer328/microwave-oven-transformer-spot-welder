PURPOSE OF MODIFICATION:
	- general optimization
	- weld pulse correction 
	- change UI
	- change OLED graphics designe  
		
GENERAL OPTIMIZTION:
	- logic optmization 
	- delete _delay_ms() which was for debounceing but it will be fixed 
	  by hardware decoupleing capacitores

WELD PULSE CORRECTION:
	- delete _delay_ms()-s and for(;;){} loops and use timer pin(PWM)
	  

HARDWARE MODIFICATION:
	- connect weld pulse pin on OCR1A/B pin (9/10) [for exact weld pulse]
	- 	


FUTURE:
	- write bootloader
		- write UART library
		- write code
			- flash memory 
			- eeprom 
			- boot security
				- lock bits and password
	- write software USB serial for pc terminal (x86 linux at 1st)
	- write welder programm (easyy)
		- write rotary encoder lib
		- import u8glib2 for i2c oled
		- write menu behaviour module 
		- error checker and safety


OLD CODE MODIFICATIONS:	
	- modify to make one weld with timer on pwm pin
